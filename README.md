# DSA Programming Challenges: Python & Java

This repository contains implementations of 53 common Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) challenges in both Python and Java. Each challenge is organized in its own folder, providing a structured way to practice and compare implementations across languages.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **53 Challenge Folders**: Each folder corresponds to a specific DSA problem or concept.
- **Files per Folder**:
  - `{Challenge_Name}.py` - Python implementation
  - `{Challenge_Name}.java` - Java implementation
  - `{Challenge_Name}.ipynb` - Jupyter notebook for interactive exploration and testing
