# DSA Programming Challenges: Python & Java

A structured learning repository for Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) challenges in Python and Java, organized into 5 progressive phases to guide learners from basic programming fundamentals to advanced object-oriented concepts.

## 5 Phases Roadmap

### 📍 Phase 1 – Core Programming Fundamentals
Focus: Building foundational programming skills with basic algorithms and logic.
- Fibonacci series
- Checking for prime number
- String palindrome
- Integer palindrome
- Armstrong number
- Factorial
- Reversing strings
- Reversing a number
- Determining leap year
- Printing patterns

### 📍 Phase 2 – Intermediate Logic + Arrays & Strings
Focus: Enhancing problem-solving with arrays, strings, and intermediate algorithms.
- Removing repeated elements from an arraylist
- Printing repetitive characters in a string
- Checking if a string contains a substring
- Checking for anagrams
- Reversing an array in place
- Reversing the order of words in a sentence
- Removing spaces in a string
- Finding the first unique character of a string

### 📍 Phase 3 – Algorithms & Sorting
Focus: Mastering search and sorting algorithms, along with mathematical computations.
- Performing binary search
- Sorting algorithms → Bubble sort, Insertion sort, Merge sort, Quick sort, Bucket sort, Counting sort
- Finding the GCD of two numbers
- Finding the square root of a number

### 📍 Phase 4 – Data Structures (Linked List, Trees, Matrix)
Focus: Implementing and manipulating core data structures.
- Linked list problems → Reversing a linked list, Finding the length, middle, nth element, Checking loops, Converting to binary tree
- Tree traversals → Pre-order, In-order, Post-order (with and without recursion), Printing leaves
- Matrix operations → Transpose, Add, Multiply

### 📍 Phase 5 – Object-Oriented Programming (Java Focus)
Focus: Applying OOP principles in Java for real-world problem-solving.
- Avoiding deadlocks
- Designing a vending machine
- Changing the order of the parameters of methods
- Overriding non-static method
